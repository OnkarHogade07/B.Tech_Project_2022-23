Description of B.Tech project - 

In a growing nation like India, supplying power is extremely difficult. Therefore, it 
is crucial to manage electricity use. A home, business, or machine's electrical energy 
production, consumption, or supply can all be measured by an energy meter, an electronic 
gadget. For the continuation of content life, electricity is a crucial necessity. For proper use, 
it must be used extremely carefully. However, despite the fact that we have requested 
additional electricity in a number of locations throughout our nation, many of them still lack 
it. We still aren't able to estimate our precise needs, and the prevailing power is still in place, 
therefore our distribution strategies are also somewhat to blame for this. The services 
provided by power providers, on the other hand, are not well received by customers. The 
process involves taking meter readings manually by appointing an employee, then 
processing that reading for costing and generating the bill. Therefore, most of the time 
consumers have complaint regarding with errors in the electricity bill. With this we can 
monitor meter and track the electric energy meter to check if any fault is there or not. Here 
we cannot avoid the any mistake or error in this process as manual operation is done.
Power utilities in various nations, particularly in developing nations like India, detect 
significant losses as a result of electricity theft. Energy theft results in significant financial 
loss. Electricity theft includes bypassing meters to steal electricity, tampering with meters to 
indicate low readings, unusual billing practices, and unpaid bills. To manage the quantity of 
energy supplied only based on the prepaid amount, the project's goal is to create and deploy 
a smart prepaid energy meter system. Customers can use the power supply in accordance 
with their available recharge, which can be topped up, thanks to this technology.
The phrase "First Pay First Served" is used when referring to the smart prepaid 
energy meter system. This system implemented with the Arduino uno and ESP 8266 wi-fi 
module is used which is provided for uploading data to the cloud. Consumers who use the 
IoT-based prepaid energy meter will monitor their real-time energy usage in the web 
database, as well as manage their whole device from the web database. To make it easier,
the number of units required can also be charged in that database. As a result, the user can
see how many units have been consumed and how many units remain. By using their user

ID, consumers can conveniently recharge their energy meter in the database. The service
provider will have complete leverage over the customer side thanks to bidirectional IOT 
connectivity. When consumers pay for electricity before using it, electricity can only be
created once. After the payment, the recharge is turned on, allowing the consumer to use the
electricity and the load to be linked to the system. The electricity will be shut off immediately
once the recharge is finished. Customers must reload their energy meters and pay for service
before using the electricity. The amount of electricity used by the user can be effectively
controlled using an energy meter system. Consumers that use power can purchase a
predetermined amount of recharge to use it just as needed. As a result, all customers will use
less energy and be more careful and responsible. This smart prepaid energy meter system
provides the block rate as per the MSEB system. This is the best feature provided by this
system. To prevent electricity theft, this project suggests a sophisticated prepaid energy
metering system. Electricity theft can be significantly minimized by combining the new steps
with the prepaid metering system. There is electricity can be stolen: by circumventing the
energy meter and by messing with it. CT is connected in series with phase and neutral in
order to build this system. The current differential between phase and neutral will reveal
information regarding theft when a consumer tries to steal by shorting the electricity phase
wire. The voltage difference between the input and output when the customer tries to bypass
by shorting both the phase and neutral will determine whether or not a theft happened. As a
result, information concerning the discovery of electricity theft will be communicated to the
consumer as well as the appropriate party.
