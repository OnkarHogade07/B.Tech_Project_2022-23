Description of B.Tech project - 

Title - Smart Pre-paid Energy Meter
Making a Prototype of pre-paid and electricity theft detection system which generates the revenue to the generation plant. Electrical supply companies are on the way of turning into private supply agencies due to loss of electricity caused by illegal activities and not paying electricity bills on time. There is a need to find out some solution on it. So, we have developed a prototype to reduce the loss of electricity due to illegal activities and pay for electricity before use. This prototype provides the services to the consumer about 
their electricity consumption with the help of UI.
